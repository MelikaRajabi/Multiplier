# Multiplier
In these files I have implemented a multiplier and then improved it. "multiplier1" can multiply 2 unsigned 8-bit numbers. "multiplier2" is the same as the previous multiplier but is more efficient in resources. "multiplier3" multiplies signed numbers. "multiplier4" can multiply numbers with given number of bits. "multiplierBooth" performs the multiplication using the Booth method. ModelSim is used to simulate and Verilog for coding. The testbenches are provided as well.
